                            <p class="card-text">A model aircraft is a small unmanned aircraft or, in  the case of a scale model, a replica of an existing or imaginary aircraft. Model  aircraft are divided into two basic groups: flying and non-flying. Non-flying models are also termed static, display, or shelf models. Aircraft manufacturers and researchers make wind tunnel  models for testing aerodynamic properties, for basic research, or for the development of new designs. Sometimes only part of the aircraft is modelled.

                            Static models range from mass-produced toys in white metal or plastic to highly accurate and detailed models produced for museum display and requiring thousands of hours of work. Many are available in kits, typically made of injection-moulded polystyrene or resin.
                                
                            Flying models range from simple toy gliders made of sheets of paper, balsa, card stock or foam polystyrene to powered scale models built up from balsa, bamboo sticks, plastic, (including both moulded or sheet polystyrene, and styrofoam), metal, synthetic resin, either alone or with carbon fibre or fibreglass, and skinned with either tissue paper, mylar and other materials. Some can be very large, especially when used to research the flight properties of a proposed full scale aircraft. <br>
                            Currently we supply the finest custom-made military and civilian aircraft models to over 50 different aircraft manufactures and hundreds of the world’s leading aerospace companies in over 68 countries. Each meticulously detailed scale model is custom-manufactured and precisely-engineered to your exact specifications.</p>

                    The idea of Aviation Shop BD was first conceived in December 1999. We decided to create a site that was dedicated to our childhood passion, model building.
